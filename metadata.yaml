# Abstract, if available
abstract: >
  The identity management, authentication, and authorization component of the
  Rubin Science Platform is responsible for maintaining a list of authorized
  users and their associated identity information, authenticating their access
  to the Science Platform, and determining which services they are permitted
  to use.  This tech note collects decisions, analysis, and trade-offs made in
  the implementation of the system that may be of future interest.  The
  historical background here may be useful for understanding design and
  implementation decisions, but would clutter other documents and distract
  from the details of the system as implemented.
